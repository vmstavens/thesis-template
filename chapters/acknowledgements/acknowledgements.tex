\section*{Acknowledgements}~\label{sec:acknowledgements}

Crafting an acknowledgement paragraph in a thesis is a heartfelt opportunity to express gratitude and recognition for the individuals and institutions that have contributed to the completion of the work. It's a chance to acknowledge the guidance, support, and inspiration received throughout the research journey. In this paragraph, one can extend appreciation to mentors, advisors, professors, and peers whose expertise and encouragement shaped the thesis. Personal gratitude to family and friends who provided emotional support during the challenging phases of research is also appropriate. Additionally, acknowledging funding sources, research facilities, and organizations that played a role in the project's success underscores the collaborative nature of academic pursuits. An acknowledgement paragraph, while concise, carries sincere sentiments that honor the shared effort and collaboration that culminated in the completion of the thesis.
