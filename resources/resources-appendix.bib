  abstract = {A triaxial electrogoniometer was used to measure functional wrist motion. Wrist motion was evaluated in 10 normal subjects who performed 52 standardized tasks. The wrist joint was found to have three degrees of freedom (flexion-extension, radioulnar deviation, and rotation). The normal functional range of wrist motion is 5 degrees of flexion, 30 degrees of extension, 10 degrees of radial deviation, and 15 degrees of ulnar deviation.},
