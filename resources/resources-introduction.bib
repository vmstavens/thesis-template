Obtaining the 6D pose of objects is the basis for many other functions such as bin picking, autopilot, etc. Therefore, many corresponding studies have been made in order to improve the accuracy and enlarge the range of application of various approaches. After several years of development, the methods of 6D pose estimation have been enriched and improved. Although some predecessors have analyzed the methods and summarized them in detailed, there have been many new breakthroughs in recent years. To understand 6D pose estimation better, this paper will make a new and more detailed review of 6D pose estimation. We divided these methods into two approaches: Learning-based approaches and non-learning-based approaches, including 2D-information-based approach and 3D-information-based approach. Additionally, we introduce the challenges that exist in 6D pose estimation. Finally, we compare the performance of different methods qualitatively and discuss the future development trends of the 6D pose estimation.},

	abstract = {As flexibility becomes an important factor in factory automation, the bin-picking system, where a robot performs pick-and-place tasks for randomly piled parts in a bin through measuring the 3D pose of an object by a 3D vision sensor, has been actively studied. However, conventional bin-picking systems that are employed for particular tasks are limited by such things as the FOV (Field of View), the shape of landmark features, and computation time. This paper proposes a general-purpose stereo vision based bin-picking system. To detect the workpiece to be picked, a geometric pattern matching (GPM) method with respect to the 2D image with a wide FOV is applied. The accurate 3D pose of a selected workpiece among the pick-up candidates is acquired by measuring the 3D positions of three features in the workpiece using the stereo camera. In order to improve the 3D position estimation performance, the GPM method is also used instead of the stereo matching method. The multiple pattern registration and ellipse fitting techniques are additionally applied to increase the reliability. The grasp position of a workpiece without collision is determined using the pose of the object and the bin information. By using these methods a practical bin-picking strategy is established to operate robustly with minimum help from the human workers in the factory. Through experiments on commercial industrial workpieces and industrial robot, we validated that the proposed vision system accurately measures the 3D pose of part and the robot successfully manipulates the workpiece among randomly stacked parts.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel method for six degrees of freedom pose estimation of objects for the application of robot arm pick and place. It is based on the use of a stereo vision system, which does not require calibration. Using both cameras, four corner points of the object are detected. A deep-neural-network (DNN) is trained for the prediction of the 6 DOF pose of the object from the four detected corner points’ coordinates in each image of both cameras. The stereo vision used is a low-end vision system placed in a custom-made setup. Before the training phase of the DNN, the robot is set to auto collect data in a predefined workspace. This workspace is defined dependently on the spatial feasibility of the robot arm and the shared field of view of the stereo vision system. The collected data represent images of a 2D marker attached to the robot arm gripper. The 2D marker is used for data collection to ease the detection of the four corner points. The proposed method succeeds in estimating the six degrees of freedom pose of the object, without the need for the determination of neither the intrinsic nor the extrinsic parameters of the stereo vision system. The optimum design of the proposed DNN is obtained after comparing different activation functions and optimizers associated with the DNN. The proposed uncalibrated DNN-based method performance is compared to that of the traditional calibration-based method. In the calibration-based method, the rotational matrix relating the robot coordinates to the stereo vision coordinates is computed using two approaches. The first approach uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) while the second approach uses a novel proposed modification of particle swarm optimization (PSO) called Hyper particle Scouts optimization (HPSO). HPSO outperforms other metaheuristic optimization algorithms such as PSO and genetic algorithm (GA). Exhaustive tests are performed, and the proposed DNN-based method is shown to outperform all tested alternatives.}

	abstract       = {6DoF object pose estimation is a foundation for many important applications, such as robotic grasping, automatic driving, and so on. However, it is very challenging to estimate 6DoF pose of transparent object which is commonly seen in our daily life, because the optical characteristics of transparent material lead to significant depth error which results in false estimation. To solve this problem, a two-stage approach is proposed to estimate 6DoF pose of transparent object from a single RGB-D image. In the first stage, the influence of the depth error is eliminated by transparent segmentation, surface normal recovering, and RANSAC plane estimation. In the second stage, an extended point-cloud representation is presented to accurately and efficiently estimate object pose. As far as we know, it is the first deep learning based approach which focuses on 6DoF pose estimation of transparent objects from a single RGB-D image. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively estimate 6DoF pose of transparent object, and it out-performs the state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin.},
