  abstract = {Quantifying behavior is crucial for many applications in neuroscience. Videography provides easy methods for the observation and recording of animal behavior in diverse settings, yet extracting particular aspects of a behavior for further analysis can be highly time consuming. In motor control studies, humans or other animals are often marked with reflective markers to assist with computer-based tracking, but markers are intrusive, and the number and location of the markers must be determined a priori. Here we present an efficient method for markerless pose estimation based on transfer learning with deep neural networks that achieves excellent results with minimal training data. We demonstrate the versatility of this framework by tracking various body parts in multiple species across a broad collection of behaviors. Remarkably, even when only a small number of frames are labeled ({\textasciitilde}200), the algorithm achieves excellent tracking performance on test frames that is comparable to human accuracy.},

  abstract = {We study the problem of creating a complete model of a physical object. Although this may be possible using intensity images, we here use images which directly provide access to three dimensional information. The first problem that we need to solve is to find the transformation between the different views. Previous approaches either assume this transformation to be known (which is extremely difficult for a complete model), or compute it with feature matching (which is not accurate enough for integration). In this paper, we propose a new approach which works on range data directly and registers successive views with enough overlapping area to get an accurate transformation between views. This is performed by minimizing a functional which does not require point-to-point matches. We give the details of the registration method and modelling procedure and illustrate them on real range images of complex objects.}

  abstract  = {We present a novel approach to the matching of subgraphs for object recognition in computer vision. Feature similarities between object model and scene graph are complemented with a regularization term that measures differences of the relational structure. For the resulting quadratic integer program, a mathematically tight relaxation is derived by exploiting the degrees of freedom of the embedding space of positive semidefinite matrices. We show that the global minimum of the relaxed convex problem can be interpreted as probability distribution over the original space of matching matrices, providing a basis for efficiently sampling all close-to-optimal combinatorial matchings within the original solution space. As a result, the approach can even handle completely ambiguous situations, despite uniqueness of the relaxed convex problem. Exhaustive numerical experiments demonstrate the promising performance of the approach which – up to a single inevitable regularization parameter that weights feature similarity against structural similarity – is free of any further tuning parameters.},

  abstract = {To solve the problem of rigid/non-rigid 3D point set registration, a novel convex hull indexed Gaussian mixture model (CH-GMM) is proposed in this paper. The model works by computing a weighted Gaussian mixture model (GMM) response over the convex hull of each point set. Three conditions, proximity, area conservation and projection consistency, are incorporated into the model so as to improve its performance. Given that the convex hull is the tightest convex set of a point set, the combination of Gaussian mixture and convex hull can effectively preserve the topological structure of a point set. Furthermore, computational complexity can be significantly reduced since only the GMM of the convex hull (instead of the whole point set) needs to be calculated. Rigid registration is achieved by seeking the best rigid transformation parameters yielding the most similar CH-GMM responses. Non-rigid deformation is realized by optimizing the coordinates of the control points used by the thin-plate spline model for interpolating the entire point set. Experiments are designed to evaluate a method׳s robustness to rotational changes between two point sets, positional noise, differences in density and partial overlap. The results demonstrated better robustness and registration accuracy of CH-GMM based method over state-of-the-art methods including iterative closest point, coherent point drift and the GMM method. Besides, the computation of CH-GMM is efficient.}

  abstract  = {This paper describes a probabilistic generative model and its associated algorithm to jointly register multiple point sets. The vast majority of state-of-the-art registration techniques select one of the sets as the ``model'' and perform pairwise alignments between the other sets and this set. The main drawback of this mode of operation is that there is no guarantee that the model-set is free of noise and outliers, which contaminates the estimation of the registration parameters. Unlike previous work, the proposed method treats all the point sets on an equal footing: they are realizations of a Gaussian mixture (GMM) and the registration is cast into a clustering problem. We formally derive an EM algorithm that estimates both the GMM parameters and the rotations and translations that map each individual set onto the ``central'' model. The mixture means play the role of the registered set of points while the variances provide rich information about the quality of the registration. We thoroughly validate the proposed method with challenging datasets, we compare it with several state-of-the-art methods, and we show its potential for fusing real depth data.},
