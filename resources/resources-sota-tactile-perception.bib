	abstract = {Different models have been used in the literature for the simulation of surface contact in biomechanical knee models. However, there is a lack of systematic comparisons of these models applied to the simulation of a common case, which will provide relevant information about their accuracy and suitability for application in models of the implanted knee. In this work a comparison of the Hertz model (HM), the elastic foundation model (EFM) and the finite element model (FEM) for the simulation of the elastic contact in a 3D model of the prosthetic knee is presented. From the results of this comparison it is found that although the nature of the EFM offers advantages when compared with that of the HM for its application to realistic prosthetic surfaces, and when compared with the FEM in CPU time, its predictions can differ from FEM in some circumstances. These differences are considerable if the comparison is performed for prescribed displacements, although they are less important for prescribed loads. To solve these problems a new modified elastic foundation model (mEFM) is proposed that maintains basically the simplicity of the original model while producing much more accurate results. In this paper it is shown that this new mEFM calculates pressure distribution and contact area with accuracy and short computation times for toroidal contacting surfaces. Although further work is needed to confirm its validity for more complex geometries the mEFM is envisaged as a good option for application in 3D knee models to predict prosthetic knee performance.}

	abstract = { A new theory in contact mechanics for modeling of soft fingers is proposed to define the relationship between the normal force and the radius of contact for soft fingers by considering general soft-finger materials, including linearly and nonlinearly elastic materials. The results show that the radius of contact is proportional to the normal force raised to the power of, which ranges from 0 to 1/3. This new theory subsumes the Hertzian contact model for linear elastic materials, where D 1/3. Experiments are conducted to validate the theory using artificial soft fingers made of various materials such as rubber and silicone. Results for human fingers are also compared. This theory provides a basis for numerically constructing friction limit surfaces. The numerical friction limit surface can be approximated by an ellipse, with the major and minor axes as the maximum friction force and the maximum moment with respect to the normal axis of contact, respectively. Combining the results of the contactmechanics model with the contact-pressure distribution, the normalized friction limit surface can be derived for anthropomorphic soft fingers. The results of the contact-mechanics model and the pressure distribution for soft fingers facilitate the construction of numerical friction limit surfaces, and will enable us to analyze and simulate contact behaviors of grasping and manipulation in robotics. }

Under the action of a normal force the penetration of the indenter and the distribution of contact pressure change. We wish to find the relations which link the pressure distribution, the resultant force on the indenter and the penetration on the assumption that the surfaces are frictionless. For indenters of arbitrary shape the problem may be solved numerically by using the Matrix Inversion Method (MIM), extended to viscoelastic case. In this method the boundary conditions are satisfied exactly at specified “matching points” (the mid-points of the boundary elements). It can be validated by comparing the numerical results to the analytic solutions in cases of a spherical asperity (loading and unloading) and a conical asperity (loading only). Finally, the method was implemented for a finite cylindrical shape with its curved face indenting the surface of the half-space. This last example shows the efficiency of the method in case of a prescribed penetration as well as a given normal load history.}

For linearly varying pressures we derive analytical expressions of displacements, strains and stresses at an arbitrary point of the half-space as a function of the loading function and of the position vectors which define the boundary of the loaded region. We briefly discuss how bilinear and more general pressure distributions can be accommodated in our formulation since the paper is mainly motivated by the interest in developing efficient computational tools for solving 3D problems in foundation engineering and contact mechanics.

The characteristic equation for elastic stability is derived. It is found that the critical flutter load for the cantilever Timoshenko beam will first decrease as the elastic foundation modulus is increased and when the elastic foundation modulus is greater than the corresponding critical value, which corresponds to the lowest critical load, it will increase, instead. In particular, if the elastic foundation modulus is large enough, the critical flutter load for the cantilever Timoshenko beam can be greater than that of the Bernoulli-Euler beam. For a clamped-translational or clamped-rotational elastic spring supported beam resting on an elastic foundation, there exists a critical value of the spring constant for each beam. At this critical point, the critical load jumps and the type of instability mechanism changes. The jump mechanisms for beams resting on elastic foundations of different modulus values are different.}

An important hurdle to such technology is the lack of in vivo contact pressure predictions. To address this issue, this study evaluates a computationally efficient simulation approach that combines the advantages of rigid and deformable body modeling. The hybrid method uses rigid body dynamics to predict body positions and orientations and elastic foundation theory to predict contact pressures between general three-dimensional surfaces. To evaluate the method, we performed static pressure experiments with a commercial knee implant in neutral alignment using flexion angles of 0, 30, 60, and 90° and loads of 750, 1500, 2250, and 3000N. Using manufacturer CAD geometry for the same implant, an elastic foundation model with linear or nonlinear polyethylene material properties was implemented within a commercial multibody dynamics software program. The model's ability to predict experimental peak and average contact pressures simultaneously was evaluated by performing dynamic simulations to find the static configuration. Both the linear and nonlinear material models predicted the average contact pressure data well, while only the linear material model could simultaneously predict the trends in the peak contact pressure data. This novel modeling approach is sufficiently fast and accurate to be used in design sensitivity and optimization studies of knee implant mechanics and ultimately wear.}

The sliding trajectories are characterized by a transient and steady-state solution. The underlying theory is first dis cussed and illustrated with several single-finger examples. Experimental results are also presented. The analysis is then extended to grasps with multiple sliding and nonslid ing fingers. The multifinger analysis is illustrated with an example of manipulating a card with two soft-contact fingers. }

In more advance way, it is the analysis of any structure by dividing the whole body into number of small elements and applying the constraints and loads on them and finding the unknowns as per our analysis and the whole analysis are done by the software itself. Initially, the FEM concept was used for solving mathematical formulations in easier way but the development of the FEM concepts and various FEM software, like NASTRAN, ANSYS, etc., made its applications to reach into fields of statistical analysis of structures, linear and non-linear analysis, heat transfer problems and also in bio engineering, nuclear engineering, metallurgical and much more, and this is possible due to the advance types of element in the FEM software. So in the research, the origin and the history of FEM is been studied and the contribution of various researchers has been shown which gives a very clear development idea of FEM and applications of FEM in daily engineering applications from past date till today. The idea of discretization is very old, the mathematical papers on FEA by Schelbach and Courant show the same approach. Earlier, before 1922, also Courant used the finite element ideas in Dirchlet's principle. The FEM we use today involves the contribution of many researchers, namely Turner, Clough, Martin and Topp, Argyris, Bubuska, Aziz, Irons, Melosh and many more, like M. J. Turner at being perfected the direct stiffness method, clough coined the term `Finite Elements', contribution of B. M. Irons towards FEA was the introduction of shape functions, patch test, text books by Huges and Bathe, Zienkiewicz laid the foundation for further advancement of FEM, and thus the period of 1962--1972 is known as the golden age of FEM and so on.}},

  abstract = {{AbstractA tool has been developed for contact mechanics analysis of the wheel-rail contact. Using measurements of wheel and rail profiles as input, the tool is based on the finite element (FE) code ANSYS. Traditionally, two methods have been used to investigate the rail-wheel contact, namely Hertz's analytical method and Kalker's software program Contact. Both are based on the half-space assumption as well as on a linear-elastic material model. The half-space assumption puts geometrical limitations on the contact. This means that the significant dimensions of the contact area must be small compared with the relative radii of the curvature of each body. Especially in the gauge corner of the rail profile, the half-space assumption is questionable since the contact radius here can be as small as 10 mm. By using the FE method (FEM) the user is not limited by these two assumptions. The profile measurement system Miniprof was used to measure the wheel and rail profiles that were used as input when generating the FE mesh.As a test case, a sharp curve (303 m radius) in a unidirectional commuter train track used by X1 and X10 trains was chosen. The results of two contact cases were compared with the results of the Hertz analytical method and the program Contact. In the first contact case the wheel was in contact with the rail gauge corner. In the second case the wheel was in contact with the rail head. In both contact cases Hertz and Contact presented very similar results for the maximum contact pressure. For the first contact case, a significant difference was found between the FE method and the Hertz method and the program Contact in all of output data. The Hertz and Contact methods both presented a maximum contact pressure that was three times larger (around 3 GPa) than the FE solution. Here, the difference was probably due to the combination of both the half-space assumption and the elastic-plastic material model. For the second contact case, there was no significant difference between the maximum contact pressure results of the three different contact mechanics methods employed. }}

  abstract = {{Wear of components is often a critical factor influencing the product service life. Wear prediction is therefore an important part of engineering. The wear simulation approach with commercial finite element (FE) software ANSYS is presented in this paper. A modelling and simulation procedure is proposed and used with the linear wear law and the Euler integration scheme. Good care, however, must be taken to assure model validity and numerical solution convergence. A spherical pin-on-disc unlubricated steel contact was analysed both experimentally and with FEM, and the Lim and Ashby wear map was used to identify the wear mechanism. It was shown that the FEA wear simulation results of a given geometry and loading can be treated on the basis of wear coefficient-sliding distance change equivalence. The finite element software ANSYS is well suited for the solving of contact problems as well as the wear simulation. The actual scatter of the wear coefficient being within the limits of $\pm$40-60\% led to considerable deviation of wear simulation results. These results must therefore be evaluated on a relative scale to compare different design options.}}

  abstract       = {{Aiming at the problem of flexible sliding tactile sensing for the actual grasp of intelligent robot fingers, a double-layer sliding tactile sensor based on fiber Bragg grating (FBG) for robot fingers is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the optimal embedding depth range of FBG in the elastic matrix of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was determined through finite element analysis and static detection experiments of finger tactile sensing. Secondly, the sensor structure is optimized and designed through the simulation and dynamic experiments of sliding sensing to determine the final array structure. Thirdly, the sensing array is actually pasted on the surface of the robot finger and the sensing characteristics testing platform is built to test and analyze the basic performance of the sliding tactile sensor. Then, the sensor array is actually attached to the finger surface of the robot and the sensing characteristics testing platform is built to experiment and analyze the basic performance of the sliding tactile sensor. Finally, a sliding tactile sensing experiment of robot finger grasping is conducted. The experimental results show that the sliding tactile sensor designed in this paper has good repeatability and creep resistance, with sensitivities of 12.4 pm/N, 11.6 pm/N, and 14.5 pm/N, respectively, and the overall deviation is controlled within 5 pm. Meanwhile, it can effectively sense the signals of the robot fingers during static contact and sliding. The sensor has a high degree of fit with the robot finger structure, and has certain application value for the perception of sliding tactile signals in the object grasping of intelligent robot objects.}},
