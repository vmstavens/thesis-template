    ABSTRACT           = {{Over the last two decades, considerable scientific and technological efforts have been devoted to developing tactile sensing based on a variety of transducing mechanisms, with prospective applications in many fields such as human-machine interaction, intelligent robot tactile control and feedback, and tactile sensorized minimally invasive surgery. This paper starts with an introduction of human tactile systems, followed by a presentation of the basic demands of tactile sensors. State-of-the-art tactile sensors are reviewed in terms of their diverse sensing mechanisms, design consideration, and material selection. Subsequently, typical performances of the sensors, along with their advantages and disadvantages, are compared and analyzed. Two major potential applications of tactile sensing systems are discussed in detail. Lastly, we propose prospective research directions and market trends of tactile sensing systems.}},

  abstract = {The major cause of disability is stroke. It is the second highest cause of death after coronary heart disease in Australia. In this paper, a post stroke therapeutic device has been designed and developed for hand motor function rehabilitation that a stroke survivor can use for bilateral movement practice. A prototype of the device was fabricated that can fully flex and extend metacarpophalangeal (MCP), proximal interphalangeal (PIP) and distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints of the fingers, and interphalangeal (IP), metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and trapeziometacarpal (IM) joints of the thumb of the left hand (impaired hand), based on movements of the right hand's (healthy hand) fingers. Out of 21 degrees of freedom (DOFs) of hand fingers, the prototype of the hand exoskeleton allowed fifteen degrees of freedom (DOFs), with three degrees of freedom (DOFs) for each finger and three degrees of freedom (DOFs) for the thumb. In addition, testing of the device on a healthy subject was conducted to validate the design requirements. }
